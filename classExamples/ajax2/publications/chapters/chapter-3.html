<p>The Mikado is The most popular Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and arguably the most popular opera ever written. This opera has delighted audiences for more than a century, and spawned a number of imitations. But none were nearly as good as the original, which represented both Gilbert and Sullivan at the height of their creative geniuses.
<p>THE MIKADO, or The Town of Titipu," was produced at the Savoy Theatre on 14 March, 1885 and proved to be one of the most famous of all the Gilbert and Sullivan Operas, running, as it did, for 672 nights.

<p>The Mikado was first produced at the Savoy on March 14th 1885.
It  is easily the most popular work in the canon. It had an
initial run of 672 performances - which remained the record at
the Savoy for a quarter of a century. It was, however, composed
at the time of the first serious disagreement between Gilbert
and (the newly knighted) Sullivan. It was composed under
pressure from D'Oyly Carte who was anxious to replace the
failing Princess Ida and the germ of the plot was probably
supplied by the hugely popular Japanese Exhibition in London in
1884-5. In order to forestall the usual pirate productions, an
English company was smuggled into New York and gave the first
American performance, at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, on July 20th
1885 with a run of 250 performances.
